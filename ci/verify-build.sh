#
# Local compile gate. Used by hand and by the tg-merge / sync-from-develop
# skills, so it must work headless with no Xcode running and with no Xcode
# project checked out.
#
# Keep the #!/bin/bash line: ci/_env.sh's worktree credential fallback depends
# on it (under /bin/sh a failed `.` on a missing file kills the shell before the
# `||` alternative can run).
#
# Nicegram Build cache
# This gate runs bazel THROUGH rules_xcodeproj's command-line API rather than
# invoking `bazel build Telegram/Telegram` itself, so that its actions have the
# same cache keys as an Xcode build and the two flows share work. Measured
# 2026-08-28, same worktree, same code:
#
#   before (Make.py build, device):  1114s, 0 cache hits after a successful
#                                   Xcode device build of the same commit
#   after  (this API path, device):     6s, every action a cache hit
#
# The reason the old path could never share is structural and was measured to
# death in the previous pass: the `xcodeproj` rule reaches its configuration
# through a Starlark transition, so its bazel-out directory carries a different
# `-ST-<hash>` suffix (`ST-9cbb67e27a8f`) than a plain label build
# (`ST-a7beea3c269e`); output paths are part of every action key, so nothing
# matched no matter how the flags were aligned. See ci/nicegram.bazelrc's
# ng_dev comment for that trail. rules_xcodeproj documents this and provides
# this API as the answer (build-system/bazel-rules/rules_xcodeproj/docs/usage.md,
# "Command-line API").
#
# Three non-obvious things about the API, each verified by measurement:
#
#  1. It does NOT need a generated `.xcodeproj`. The runner script creates the
#     generator package itself at run time (templates/runner.sh:124-131);
#     the installed project is only used by the generation branch. Verified by
#     moving Telegram/Telegram.xcodeproj away and running this path: exit 0.
#     It DOES need `xcodeproj.bazelrc` (below) and
#     build-input/configuration-repository.
#
#  2. `--generator_output_groups=all_targets`, the form the docs lead with, is
#     the wrong scope for a compile gate: Telegram/BUILD declares Xcode
#     configurations Debug AND Release and target environments device AND
#     simulator, so `all_targets` is four full app builds plus the UI test
#     suite. Measured: 26,880 actions, 1900s, with 1129 log references to
#     `bazel-out/ios_arm64-opt-...`. This gate asks for one configuration's app
#     product instead, through the per-target `bp <target-id>` output group --
#     the same group rules_xcodeproj's own Xcode scripts drive (see
#     bazel_integration_files/generate_index_build_bazel_dependencies.sh).
#     Measured: 4,528 actions for the Debug device app. That group is not
#     perfectly one configuration -- alongside the requested configuration's
#     products it carries a dozen rules_xcodeproj-generated Info.plists in each
#     of the other three, which is why --show_result prints paths under
#     `-opt-` and `ios_sim_arm64` directories even on a device run. Those are
#     plist-writing actions, not compiles: the whole run is ~146 processes
#     against 26,880 for all_targets.
#
#  3. A `bp <target-id>` group name that does not exist is NOT an error: bazel
#     exits 0 and prints "Build completed successfully, 1 total action" having
#     built nothing. Verified with a deliberately bogus id. So this script
#     derives the id from the target-ids file the build itself produces, and
#     then asserts, positively, that the build reported outputs under the
#     expected configuration directory. Without that assertion a rules_xcodeproj
#     upgrade that renamed the group would turn this gate permanently green.

# Nicegram Build cache
# A device build signs the app and its six extensions, so it needs a
# development identity in a keychain. Check now: without this the failure lands
# at the very end of a ~20-minute build, after all the compilation is done.
#
# The obvious check --
#   security find-identity -v -p codesigning | grep -q "Apple Development"
# -- is WORTHLESS here, and was verified so on 2026-08-27: this machine had two
# "Apple Development" identities (personal-team certs) while the device build
# failed with `Unable to find an identity on the system matching the ones in
# .../Intents.mobileprovision`. The profiles resolved from the codesigning
# repository name ONE specific certificate each, and having some unrelated
# development cert installed proves nothing. A check that reports green and lets
# the build fail twenty minutes later is worse than no check at all.
#
# So compare against what the RESOLVED PROFILES actually require: hash each
# DeveloperCertificates entry in the provisioning profiles Make.py wrote, and
# require at least one of those SHA-1s to appear in the installed identities.
#
# Placed here (after `. ./_env.sh`, not before bootstrap-submodules.sh) because
# it needs $SOURCE_PATH, which _env.sh is what defines: inserting it any
# earlier would resolve prov_dir against an empty SOURCE_PATH (silently
# becoming "/build-input/...", i.e. the filesystem root) and the check would
# always take the "never resolved yet" branch, regardless of whether profiles
# actually exist -- exactly the "reports green, proves nothing" failure this
# check exists to avoid. Still runs well before the build starts.
#
# Ordering caveat, worth knowing rather than restructuring for: this runs
# BEFORE the `resolve_config` step below, which deletes and re-fetches the
# provisioning directory. So on the first run in a fresh checkout it takes the
# "no profiles yet" branch and only warns, and if a freshly fetched profile
# ever started requiring a certificate the previous one did not, this check
# would have read the old requirement. It is deliberately placed here anyway:
# what it tests is which CERTIFICATE is installed, which no step of this script

# bazel does announce it, though. When the option set differs from whatever last

# xcodeproj.bazelrc looks like (measured 2026-08-28: removing the file produced
# `--//Telegram:disableStripping, --@@rules_swift+//swift:copt, --define, and 1
# more have changed` -- while the target ids stayed byte-identical, so nothing

#
# Two scoping rules, both learned by getting them wrong first.
#
# It must be scoped to the INNER invocation of each step, i.e. everything after
# that log's last "Running command line: ...-runner.sh" line. The OUTER base
# legitimately discards its analysis twice on every single run, because
# `resolve_config`'s aquery (-c dbg --ios_multi_cpus=sim_arm64 --define=...) and
# the plain `bazel run` alternate two different option sets there. That is cheap
# (the outer base analyses 8 packages) and meaningless; unscoped, this check
# would fire every time and be ignored within a week.
#
# And it must look at BOTH steps, not just the build. The divergence surfaces in
# whichever inner invocation runs FIRST, which is the target-ids step -- that one
# absorbs the reconfiguration, and the build step a second later sees matching
# options and says nothing. Checked only the build log at first and watched a

#
# Verified to stay silent on: a warm repeat run, alternating --device/--sim, a
