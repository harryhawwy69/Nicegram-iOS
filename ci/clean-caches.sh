# Nicegram Build cache
# Reports every build-state store on this machine and, with --yes, deletes the
# ones classified `orphan` -- their recorded checkout path is no longer
# reachable on disk (see ci/lib/orphans.sh for exactly what "recorded" means
# per store kind; for DerivedData it is the *generated*, gitignored
# Telegram.xcodeproj path, not the worktree directory itself, so a live
# worktree that has never run ci/generate-project.sh has no such path yet and
# also classifies `orphan`).
#
# Why this exists: creating a git worktree gives Bazel a new workspace path,
# and therefore a brand-new output base (12-70 GB each), and gives Xcode a new
# DerivedData directory (up to 18 GB each). Deleting the worktree removes
# neither. As measured on 2026-08-27: 155 GB of output bases with 54 GB
# orphaned, and 111 GB of DerivedData with 49 GB orphaned.
#
# IF THIS REPORTS `live` FOR A WORKTREE YOU JUST DELETED, the recorded path
# still exists, and there are two mundane reasons for that -- both measured
# 2026-08-28:
#
#   1. Its bazel servers are still running. They idle for --max_idle_secs=10800
#      (3 hours), there are two per worktree (the outer one and
#      rules_xcodeproj's nested one), and an idle server RECREATES its
#      --workspace_directory. Kill them first:
#        pkill -f -- "--workspace_directory=<abs worktree path>( |\$)"
#      The `( |$)` anchor matters: `pkill -f` matches substrings, so without it
#      the pattern also matches any worktree whose path merely starts with
#      that one, and kills its servers mid-build.
#   2. `git worktree remove --force` can leave gitignored build output behind
#      (observed: Telegram/Telegram.xcodeproj/project.xcworkspace, 16 KB), and
#      that is enough to keep the path alive. `rm -rf` the directory after
#      removing the worktree.
#
# The classification itself is not at fault in either case -- the path really
# does exist. Nothing here guesses, so nothing here can work around it.
#
# Safety: prints the whole table first; deletes only entries classified `orphan`
# by ci/lib/orphans.sh (never `unknown`); requires an explicit --yes. The
# classification is tested in ci/tests/test-orphans.sh. Immediately before each
# delete, the classification is re-checked (not just assumed from the report
# printed a moment earlier), and a directory rm -rf cannot fully remove is
# reported rather than silently left partially deleted -- the script exits
# non-zero at the end if that happens, so a partial prune is never reported as
# success.
#
# Not touched here: the Bazel disk cache and repository cache. The disk cache is
# bounded by Bazel's own GC (see ci/nicegram.bazelrc); wiping it by hand throws
# away the cross-worktree reuse this whole effort exists to get.
