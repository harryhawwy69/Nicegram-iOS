# Nicegram Build cache
# Orphan detection for build-state directories.
#
# Both Bazel and Xcode record, inside each state directory, the absolute path of
# the checkout it belongs to. If that path no longer exists, the state is
# unreachable garbage -- no heuristic and no name-mangling guess involved:
#
#   Bazel output base   ->  <dir>/DO_NOT_BUILD_HERE   contains the workspace root
#   Xcode DerivedData   ->  <dir>/info.plist          WorkspacePath key
#
# Deliberately conservative: anything we cannot positively classify comes back
# `unknown`, and callers must never delete `unknown`. That covers Bazel's own
# install/ and cache/ directories and Xcode's ModuleCache.noindex /
# SDKStatCaches.noindex, none of which carry a marker.
#
# This file is sourced, not executed. Its tests are ci/tests/test-orphans.sh.

# Returns 1 when there is no marker to read.
