# Nicegram Build cache
# Turns a captured bazel build log into a short, comparable summary.
#
# Why: before this, no flow recorded how long it took or how much it reused, so
# "the release build took 20 minutes" could not be attributed to anything. Every
# claim about cache behaviour in docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-27-build-cache-audit-design.md
# is meant to be reproducible from these numbers.
#
# The patterns below are verbatim bazel 8.4.2 output, captured 2026-08-27:
#
#   INFO: Analyzed target //Telegram:Telegram (412 packages loaded, 21877 targets configured).
#   INFO: Elapsed time: 128.451s, Critical Path: 42.10s
#   INFO: 12043 processes: 9877 disk cache hit, 2100 internal, 66 darwin-sandbox.
#   INFO: 1 process: 1 action cache hit, 1 internal.
#
# Note "1 process:" versus "12043 processes:" -- bazel switches to the singular,
# so every pattern here accepts both.
#
# There is deliberately no "did this build reconfigure?" field here, and not
# because bazel stays quiet about it: 8.4.2 does print
#   WARNING: Build options --//Telegram:disableStripping, ... have changed,
#   discarding analysis cache
# whenever a configuration-affecting flag changes against a warm server. (An
# earlier draft of this comment claimed the opposite; it was measured on a cold
# server, where there is no prior analysis to discard.) Reading that line
# correctly needs scoping this file cannot apply -- a wrapper's log holds an
# OUTER bazel invocation that legitimately reconfigures on every run plus the
# nested ones that matter. ci/verify-build.sh's ng_inner_divergence does that
# scoping and owns the check; what this file reports instead is the "targets
# configured" count, which shows the re-analysis cost either way.
#
# `disk cache hit` counts work fetched from --disk_cache (cross-worktree,
# cross-flow reuse -- what this effort is trying to create). `action cache hit`
# counts work already valid in this output base (ordinary incrementality).
# They mean different things and are reported separately.
#
# What every ci/ wrapper actually captures is not this raw output, though --
# it's `fastlane ... | tee log`, and fastlane relays each bazel line wrapped in
# a "[HH:MM:SS]: " timestamp, a "▸ " marker, and an ANSI SGR colour escape.
# ng_report_field normalizes that dressing away (see _ng_report_normalize)
# before matching the patterns above, so both shapes parse; the fastlane
# shape is covered by its own fixture in ci/tests/test-report.sh.
#
# This file is sourced, not executed. Its tests are ci/tests/test-report.sh.
#

# Strips fastlane's line dressing so the ^INFO:/^ERROR: patterns below match a
# log captured through `fastlane ... | tee log` (every ci/ wrapper) the same
# way they already match a raw `bazel build` log (every pre-fastlane fixture
# below). fastlane relays each bazel line prefixed with a "[HH:MM:SS]: "
# timestamp and a "▸ " marker, and wrapped in an ANSI SGR colour escape --
# verbatim, one real captured line:
#
#   [14:59:26]: ▸ <ESC>[35mINFO: Elapsed time: 12.169s, Critical Path: 0.04s<ESC>[0m
#
# BSD sed does not understand a backslash \x1b escape, so the ESC byte is
# built with `printf` rather than written into the pattern directly. A line
# with none of this dressing (i.e. every existing fixture, and a direct
# `bazel build` invocation) matches none of the three substitutions below and
# passes through unchanged -- this is a no-op on genuine bazel output.
